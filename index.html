        <p>PV Sindhu or Pusarla Venkata Sindhu was born to P.V Raman and P. Vijaya. She comes from a family of sports, where both her parents are erstwhile national-level volleyball players. She also has an elder sister P.V. Divya.


            
            Sindhu picked up interest in Badminton after she was galvanized by the success of Pullela Gopichand. At the age of 8, she acquired basic badminton lessons from unsung badminton hero Mir Mahboob Ali. Sindhu used to attend his training at his badminton academy at the Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Sucerdaband. Unfortunately, her coach Mir Mahboob Ali passed away in 2011.

She had shown immense dedication towards badminton and traveled 56 kilometers every day from home to the academy. Under the tutelage of Gopichand, her badminton career blossomed.
